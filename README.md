# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

You have been provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

### Conclusion: 
The myopia data was prepared and reduced using PCA and t-SNE, and then subjected to K-Means cluster analysis. The analysis indicates that the ideal number of clusters is 3, but t-SNE was ineffective due to random noise. Although some patterns were noticed, the dataset is insufficient for precise predictions or further training. To enhance clustering accuracy and try other models, it is recommended to collect a larger dataset and divide it into test and training sets.
